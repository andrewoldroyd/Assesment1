// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning

// Andrew's Answer:
// planning
// analysis
// design
// testing
// implementation
// maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

//Andrew's answer:
// let planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."
//note: using let, can be var or const too
let analysis = "This is the second step, where the goal is to gather details and come up with ideas."
let design = "This is the third step, where you write out those ideas in code."
// let implementation = "This is the fifth step, where you impliment the tested code."
// let testing = "This is the fourth step, where you test the code."
let maintain = "This is the sixth step, where you maintain the code that was implemented."
